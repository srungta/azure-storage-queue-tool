# azure-storage-queue-tool
This is C# .Net standard console app to send messages to Azure Storage Queue.

The client uses the instructions in the official Microsoft documentation available at 
https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/queues/storage-dotnet-how-to-use-queues

## Nuget Dependency 
Microsoft.WindowsAzure.Storage

## Why this application
I had to send massive number of queue messages to a test queue. and instead of writing some patchy code, it was better to write it in some reusable form.
